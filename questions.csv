In any clinical trial, there is an objective which usually aims to demonstrate that the study drug has the desired effect.
That effect can only be determined when there is a well-controlled trial.
(A) is incorrect as even a trial with a poor study design could be monitored in compliance with the monitoring plan and be considered closely monitored.
(B) is incorrect as an IP which has met GMP standards does not affect the study design. (D) is incorrect as comprehensive source documentation is only one aspect of a clinical trial, and even if it has been 100% source document verified (SDV), may not result in the necessary data to achieve the

Option 1: “Satisfactory” is too general, does not provide quantitative data, so as a stand-alone criteria it is not correct.

As per ICH E6 6.9.2, the number of subjects planned to be enrolled is a key component of protocols and amendments. Any changes to the original planned number of subjects would necessitate an amendment as it affects the statistics linked to the study.
While the ICH E6 6.1 states that the sponsor’s name and address, etc… are required, a merger does not necessarily mean that there was a change in sponsor name or address, etc… and therefore (D) is incorrect.
